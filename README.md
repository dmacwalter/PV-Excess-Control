## About

PV Excess Control is built and maintained by Henrik Wasserfuhr, founder of [**InventoCasa**](https://inventocasa.de). We are specialized smart home integrators, designing and deploying complete Home Assistant environments for new builds, renovations, and retrofits.

This integration is open source because I believe in giving back to the community that makes Home Assistant great. It’s also a core component I use in my professional builds. If you want a complete smart home designed, configured, and commissioned from start to finish, InventoCasa takes on a limited number of custom projects each year.

## Features

### Core Optimization & Planning
- **Smart Planning** - 24-hour forward-looking optimizer with weather-aware pre-planning and configurable plan influence.
- **Priority-Based Appliance Control** - Manage multiple appliances with configurable priorities (1-1000).
- **Opportunity Cost** - Factors in feed-in tariff revenue when making decisions.
- **Appliance Dependencies** - Chain appliances so one only runs when another is active.
- **Per-Appliance Averaging Window** - Custom smoothing period per appliance for excess power calculations.
- **Min/Max Runtime & Time Windows** - Ensure appliances run for required durations and restrict them to specific hours.

### EV & Battery Management
- **EV SoC-Aware Charging** - Considers EV battery level, connection status, and user-defined targets.
- **Schedule Deadlines** - Set constraints like "EV must be charged by 7am".
- **Dynamic Current Control** - Variable amperage for EV chargers and wallboxes (6-32 A).
- **Battery-Aware Optimization** - Three strategies: Battery First, Appliance First, Balanced.
- **Minimum Battery SoC Protection** - Shed appliances when battery level drops below a configured threshold.
- **Battery Discharge Protection** - Limit discharge rate when big consumers are running.

### Tariffs & Grid
- **Tariff Integration** - Support for Tibber, Awattar, Nordpool, Octopus Energy, and generic price sensors.
- **Export Limit Management** - Absorb would-be-curtailed power when feed-in caps apply.
- **Grid Supplementation** - Allow a small amount of grid power to top up appliances.

### UI, Analytics & Integrations
- **Solar Forecast Integration** - Solcast, Forecast.Solar, and generic forecast sensors.
- **Extensive Dashboard Examples** — Build your own dashboard with Mushroom, ApexCharts and other community cards. [Full YAML examples included](docs/dashboard-examples.md).
- **Self-Consumption Analytics** - Track savings, self-consumption ratio, energy statistics.
- **Manual Override** - Force appliances on/off from the dashboard.
- **Configurable Notifications** - Per-event toggles for appliance changes, daily summaries, warnings.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.8 or newer
- A solar inverter with power sensors exposed to Home Assistant
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) for the recommended installation method

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant sidebar
2. Click the three-dot menu and select **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/InventoCasa/PV-Excess-Control` as an **Integration**
4. Search for "PV Excess Control" and click **Download**
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **PV Excess Control**

### Manual

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `custom_components/pv_excess_control` folder into your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **PV Excess Control**

## Quick Start

1. **Add the integration** - Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → PV Excess Control
2. **Configure your inverter** - Select Standard or Hybrid, then map your power sensors
3. **Configure energy pricing** - Select your tariff provider or leave it as None
4. **Add appliances** - Use the integration's sub-device UI to add each appliance
5. **Set up your dashboard** — See the [Dashboard Examples](docs/dashboard-examples.md) for ready-to-use YAML configurations using popular community cards.

See the [full documentation](docs/) for detailed setup guides.

## Architecture

The integration uses a hybrid real-time + planning approach:

- **Real-time Controller** (every 30 s) - Reads live sensor data, applies optimizer decisions
- **Forward-Looking Planner** (every 15 min) - Creates optimal 24-hour schedules using forecast and tariff data
- **Pure-Logic Optimizer** - Zero HA dependencies, fully unit-testable decision engine
