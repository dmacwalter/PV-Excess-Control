# Battery Management

PV Excess Control integrates with hybrid inverter systems to make battery-aware optimization decisions.

## Strategies

Three strategies control how the battery is treated relative to appliances:

### Battery First
The battery is charged to the target SoC before any appliances are turned on. Best for maximizing self-sufficiency -- the battery is always ready for the evening.

### Appliance First
Appliances run using solar excess before any power goes to the battery. Best for time-sensitive tasks (EV charging deadline, dishwasher cycle) where you want maximum runtime during solar hours.

### Balanced
Excess solar is split proportionally between battery charging and appliances. The split is calculated so that both reach their targets at the same time.

## Target SoC and Target Time

Set a **Target SoC** (e.g. 80 %) and **Target Time** (e.g. 07:00) to tell the planner when the battery needs to be ready.

The planner uses the forecast to calculate:
1. How much energy is needed to reach the target (`capacity x (target_soc - current_soc) / 100`)
2. Which hours have sufficient solar excess to charge
3. Whether grid charging is needed to meet the deadline

---

## Grid Charging

If **Allow Grid Charging** is enabled and the battery cannot reach its target using solar alone, the planner will schedule grid charging during the cheapest available hours before the deadline.

Example: EV and battery both need charging by 7 am. Cheapest grid hours are 01:00-04:00. The planner schedules battery charging from 02:00-04:00 to minimize cost.

Grid charging only activates when the tariff is below the **Battery Charge Price Threshold**.

---

## Battery Discharge Protection

Mark high-power appliances (heat pump, EV charger, tumble dryer) as **Big Consumer** to enable discharge protection.

When a big consumer is running and the battery SoC is below a safety threshold, the integration can limit the battery discharge rate. This prevents the battery from draining too fast and triggering grid import spikes.

Configure **Battery Discharge Override** per appliance (e.g. 500 W) to set the limit.

---

## Minimum Battery SoC Protection

The `min_battery_soc` threshold (configured in the battery settings) protects the battery from excessive discharge. When the battery SoC drops below this threshold, the optimizer will shed appliances to reduce load and prevent further battery drain.

This works in conjunction with Battery Discharge Protection: while discharge protection limits the discharge rate for big consumers, the min SoC threshold triggers active shedding of appliances when the battery level is critically low.

## Common Issues

**Battery charges during expensive hours**
Ensure the **Battery Charge Price Threshold** is set correctly and is lower than your normal import price.

**Battery never reaches target SoC**
Check that the battery capacity is set correctly and that the battery SoC sensor is reporting accurate values. Also verify the battery power sensor is positive when charging.

**Grid charging not activating**
"Allow Grid Charging" must be enabled. The tariff provider must be configured so the integration knows when prices are cheap.
